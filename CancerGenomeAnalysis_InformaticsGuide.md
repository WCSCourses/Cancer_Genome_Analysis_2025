## **To run the SigProfiler software you will have to activate an environment (mutational_signatures_env), What is an Environment?**
An environment is an isolated space where specific software, dependencies, and libraries are installed. It ensures that all required tools run in a controlled and reproducible way, avoiding conflicts with other system applications.

## For this course, we use the **mutational_signatures_env**  environment.

⚠️ **Note:** Software will **not work outside the environment.**

## **How to Activate the mutational_signatures_env Environment**
Before using any software, activate the environment with:

```bash
conda activate mutational_signatures_env
```

## **To deactivate the environment when you're done:**

```bash
conda deactivate
```

## Informatics Set-Up
For installation and setup, please refer to the following guides:

- **[Oracle VM VirtualBox Installation Guide](https://github.com/WCSCourses/index/blob/main/VM_Guide.md)** – Detailed instructions for installing and configuring VirtualBox on different operating systems. *(Note: Separate installations are needed for Intel-based and ARM-based Macs, and the VDI files will differ.)*
- **[Docker Installation Guide](https://github.com/WCSCourses/index/blob/main/Docker_guide.md)** – Step-by-step guide for installing Docker on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

The Host Operating System Requirements are: <br />
- RAM requirement: 8GB (preferably 12GB) <br />
- Processor requirement: 4 processors (preferably 8) <br />
- Hard disk space: 200GB <br />
- Admin rights to the computer <br />
